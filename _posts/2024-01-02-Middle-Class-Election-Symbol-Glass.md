It is very usual for Pawan Kalyan to be trending every month on Twitter for one or the other reasons - be it, his movies, his speeches or his fans keep on the spirit of Janasena alive. One such another organic trend is happenning right now on Twitter.

> మాది మిడిల్ క్లాస్! మా గుర్తు గ్లాస్!!

A quotation has been making rounds on Twitter, "మాది మిడిల్ క్లాస్! మా గుర్తు గ్లాస్!!" This roughly translates to "Ours is middle class! Our elections symbol is Glass". It is clear that the message is clear here. It is very surprising and at the same time very heartening that Prabhas and Mahesh Babu fans are also retweeting the tweet. The wind for Pawan Kalyan has been positive.

> It is very heartening to see Prabhas and Mahesh Babu fans are also retweeting and wishing better days for Andhra Pradesh.

As usual Pawan Kalyan has been very active meeting his candidates in Godavari and Visakhapatnam districts. Political pundits have been expecting great results for Pawan Kalyan. And, asking Janasainiks to be highly active with all the spirits until the elections.
