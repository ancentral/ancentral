It is very usual for Pawan Kalyan to be trending every month on Twitter for one or the other reasons - be it, his movies, his speeches or his fans keep on the spirit of Janasena alive. One such another organic trend is happenning right now on Twitter.

A quotation has been making rounds on Twitter, "మాది మిడిల్ క్లాస్! మా గుర్తు గ్లాస్!!" This roughly translates to "Ours is middle class! Our elections symbol is Glass". It is clear that the message is clear here. It is very surprising and at the same time very heartening that Prabhas and Mahesh Babu fans are also retweeting the tweet. The wind for Pawan Kalyan has been positive.
