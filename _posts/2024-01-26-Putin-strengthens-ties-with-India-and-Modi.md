Russia has been a strong ally for India and vice-versa. India and Indians have immense respect for Russia and Putin. On the occasion of Republic day of India, Putin praised the future of India and willed to make more investments in India strengthening the bond with India and ties.

"India has one of the highest rates of economic development and growth in the world, and that too is due to the leadership qualities of the incumbent Prime Minister. It was during his leadership that India reached such a pace," Putin said as per the translation by Russia-based media network Russia Today (RT), reported news agency ANI.

> "India is pursuing an independent foreign policy, which is not easy in today's world. But, India with a population of 1.5 billion has the right to do so. And under the leadership of the Prime Minister, that right is being realised. This is not just a statement, it is important from the point of organising joint work because it gives us the opportunity to forecast the actions of our partners in the medium and long terms," Putin said.

During the interaction, Putin mentioned India's policy of 'Make in India' and reiterated Russia's commitment to help the country. He highlighted huge financial investments by a Russian company in India.

> "India has made huge steps in development, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His campaign 'Make in India' has been heard by many including Russia. And we are trying with our Indian friends to bring to life all these plans...the largest foreign investment in India has come from Russia. USD 23 billion was invested by our company Rosneft, acquisition of an oil refinery, a network of gas stations, a port and so on," Putin said.

Modi has made India great again and resurrect from the points where Congress had taken India to. Congress cader line of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi look too weak infront of Modi and Indians are hoping to see Modi as PM in his continued 3rd term.
