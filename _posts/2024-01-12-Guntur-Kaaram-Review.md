Well, "Aa kurchee madata petti...", Trivikram, Mahesh and Team came up with a trendy worded song and songs have been hit. The trailer created frenzy. "Ramana" gaadu created so much interest. Let us see what this movie is about.

## What this movie is about?

Vyra Vasundhara (Ramya Krishna) leaves her son Ramana (Mahesh Babu) when he was ten years old and her husband for a reason only known to her. She gets married again. Ramana grows up and that is when his grandfather Venkataswamy (Prakash Raj) influential politician, comes back into Ramana’s life forcing him to cut ties forever with his mother. 

Why did Vasundhara leave Ramana? How does Ramana deal with his grandfather? The answers to these questions are all about Guntur Kaaram.

## Performances

- Of course Mahesh Babu is super impressive in the role of 'Ramana' gaadu. He heavy lifted this entire movie. When narration or screenplay was not good, it was Mahesh who rescued the scenes. The man gets into that mass character and does full justice to the role. Even though the role is not very common for him, it was a cake walk for him. You will love him.

- Sreeleela was given a love-interest role. Nothing more or nothing less. 

- Meenakshi Chaudhary has got a very brief role and she is alright. She grabs the eyes of the yough with her dusky beauty. 

- Ramya Krishna, Prakash Raj, and Murli Sharma are usual. Jayaram’s character appears repetitive. Jagapathi Babu appears in a so very ordinary role which we don’t expect at all. Ajay, Vennela Kishore, and Eeswari Rao did their job.

## Technicalities

Guntur Kaaram is not-so-great work from both the director and the music director. Well, we know the talents of Trivikram and Thaman. The trailer and songs created buzz because of the established names of these persona. But, it did not live on. Same with the movie too. 

The comedy is not up to the mark. It becomes dull. As we said earlier, it is Mahesh who heavy lifted the movie.

The background music is so lifeless and unsteady that it doesn’t make any scene impressive. The songs Dum Masala and Kurchi Madathapetti songs are passable and the remaining songs just come and go.

## Thumbs Up
- Mahesh Babu
- Sreeleela Dance

## Thumbs Down
- Saying "Everything else" is rude. So, won't be mentioning that.

## Verdict
Fans, go watch it. It is tailor made for you guys.
