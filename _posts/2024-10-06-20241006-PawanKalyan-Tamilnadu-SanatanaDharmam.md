In Kistareddypet, three Reinforced Cement Concrete(RCC) structures were demolished, freeing up one acre. Additionally, 25 RCC structures were torn down in Patelguda, resulting in the reclamation of three acres. Through these efforts, HYDRAA has reclaimed a total of approximately 8 acres of valuable government land.
