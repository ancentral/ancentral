It is not very uncommon that YSRCP government keeps changing rules on the fly just for some targeted persons. And, that person is none other than Janasena Pawan Kalyan who has been a nightmare for entire cadre of YSRCP Party. 

In the past, just for Pawan Kalyan movies, they lowered the ticket rates to laughable number. No wonder how people looked at these baby-acts of YSRCP people.

Now, as we all know, Pawan Kalyan garu is geared up for his 4 day meetings in Bhimavaram, Amalapuram, Kakinada and Rajahmundry, YSRCP did not allow Pawan's helicopter to land. The reasons are unknown. And, people would not care about the reasons as it is clear what might be the reason.

Janasena party offically posted this image on their X/Twitter handle.
