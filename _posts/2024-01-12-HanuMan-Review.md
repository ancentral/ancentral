The makers promoted the movie aggressively. And, this movie has been in news for various reasons such as theatrical slots and allocations; date announcements etc.  The team is highly confident, so they went ahead with special premiers all over. Did Hanu-Man live up to the massive expectations surrounding it? Let’s find out.

## What this movie is about?
Protagonist name is Hanumanthu (Teja Sajja), hailing from Anjanadri, is a small thief. His elder sister, Anjamma (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar), who takes immense care of him. Hanumanthu loves Meenakshi (Amritha Aiyer), who also belongs to the same village. Gajapathi (Raj Deepak Shetty) pretends to be the savior of Anjanadhri from bandits, but he exercises control over the villagers. 

Meenakshi revolts against Gajapathi one day, which makes the latter attack the former. While trying to save Meenakshi, Hanumanthu lands in trouble. This is when Hanumanthu finds a precious stone through which he gets superpowers. What happened next? How did Hanumanthu use his superpowers? How is Micheal (Vinay Rai) connected to the plot? Watch the film to know the answers.

## Performances

What works well with HanuMan is its goosebumps-inducing moments and humor. Prasanth Varma designed a few ultimate sequences elevating Lord Hanuman, and audiences are sure to go bonkers for these scenes. They are well-written, and the solid background score by Gowra Hari during those scenes takes the impact to the next level.

Particularly, the lengthy finale episode is sure to blow the minds, and the VFX works here are impressive. Comparatively, there is more drama and emotions in the second hour. Though the pacing slows down at times, the high moments drive the film forward. One such sequence that lifts the spirits is the fight sequence, where Teja saves Amritha. Aiyer is neatly composed. The icing on the cake here is the folk song played in the background.

From the moment Teja Sajja receives superpowers, the movie becomes more entertaining. The star heroes’ references are neatly injected into the narrative, and the comedy scenes that follow those references episode are pretty much engaging. The interval action block is designed well. It is both entertaining and powerful at the same time.

Teja Sajja played his role to perfection. As an underdog, Teja did a convincing job, and his vulnerability is neatly shown. Teja’s performance was too good in the latter hour. Varalaxmi Sarathkumar did a good job. Amritha Aiyer is fine as Teja’s love interest. Satya and Getup Srinu tickles the fun bones with their mannerisms.

## Technicalities

The background score by Gowra Hari is superlative, and especially his work during the climax block is first-rate. The folk song was good on screen, and the rest were decent. The cinematography by Shivendra is neat. The editing isn’t great, and a few sequences could have been shortened.

Prasanth Varma’s vision is superb, and the young director played to the gallery with Hanu-Man. Even though the movie has a beaten-to-death concept, the director inserts high moments at regular intervals and keeps one engaged. Prasanth Varma takes the impact a few notches higher with the last twenty minutes. All the scenes related to Lord Hanuman are well presented.

## Thumbs Up
- Simple story (no confusion) and direction
- Great VFX
- Hanuman scenes

## Thumbs Down
- First 20 minutes are slow (but, you would forget this slowness during the rest of the movie)
