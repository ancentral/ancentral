You may want to read [Yaatra - 2 review here.](https://andhracentral.com/latest/yaatra-2-review).

Yaatra 2 is supposed to be a biopic film. But, the movie is altered to a level that it became a fantasy film. This happens when a film is made to cater to just some group of people. Also, the movie is very well timed for elections, Siddham sabha etc. 

> Some people said, it is to "rejuvenate" the "morales" of volunteers and YCP's vote bank people.

YSRCP party has an agenda in that movie. Some people said, it is to "rejuvenate" the "morales" of volunteers and YCP's vote bank people. The frenzy would be high on release date. So, usually, at least some groups of people would run to the theaters.

> Also, YCP people must have realized that this is not a Pawan Kalyan movie to reduce the price of the tickets to Rs. 5/-

Also, this is not a Pawan Kalyan movie to reduce the price of the tickets to Rs. 5/-. The reason YSRCP gave for that pricing for Pawan Kalyan movie is that their "wish" is that entertainment should be available even for common man. But, YSRCP does not have this reason for Yaatra 2 movie. The price of this movie ticket is not Rs. 5/-. 

Yaatra 2 needs a target of Rs. 8 crores for break-even. But on the first day it got only 98 lakhs of collections. People said that the educated people did not even care to watch the film. 

Before we see the collections of this movie, this is how the hype trended for this movie.

| Day #    | Hype Level | Collections |
| -------- | ------- | ---|
| Day - 1 | High | 98 lakhs rupees (AP + TG) |
| Day - 2 | Dull | 21 lakhs rupees (AP + TG) |
| Day - 3 | Dull | 8 lakhs rupees (AP + TG) |

Well, this is not a movie that was made for artistic values, or to gain some awards or to stand for decades for being a great movie. This movie is made only to make some people ready to vote for YSRCP. The collections look legit.
