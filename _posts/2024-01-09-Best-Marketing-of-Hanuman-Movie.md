HanuMan has been on top charts for creating so much buzz and interest. As per [BookMyShow (BMS)](https://andhracentral.com/latest/hanuman-is-the-biggest-movie), the interest shown by public for this movie is great than Superstar Mahesh Babu's Guntur Kaaram.

There is so much going on with this movie about theaters allocation, date announcements etc. But, the movie producers or directors are not swaying way and they are firm on their release.

Twitteratis and movie lovers are in awe of the way the movie has been coming up with `"N" days to go` posters. These posters are so creative and interesting. And, there are fan made posters too. These posters and campaigning are lauded by industry pundits that it is conveything the movie is in the Sankranti race, indeed. As you all know, there were some rumors couple of weeks back that this movie is out of Sankranti race, this interesting campaigning has been helping this movie a lot and it made it's firm place in Sankranti race.

Kudos to Prasanth Varma (movie director) and team.
