Sankranthi 2024 box-office battle just got fierce, despite the absence of Ravi Teja’s Eagle from the race. Last night, producer Dil Raju, the President of the Producers’ Council, provided priority ratings to Sankranti movies based on the stature of the heroes. However, an unpopular opinion prevailing in the public is that HanuMan has not received the recognition it rightly deserves.

While Dil Raju ranked Mahesh Babu’s film “Guntur Karam” as number one, followed by Nagarjuna and Venkatesh’s films “Na Sami Ranga” and “Saindhav,” he placed the film “Hanuman” in the last position.

However, as measured by Book My Show (BMS) interests, audience interest suggests a different perspective.

> According to BMS, “Hanuman” holds the top ranking in terms of audience interest, with over 2 lakh interests, surpassing even “Guntur Karam” by a thousand.

In contrast, the other Sankranti films, “Naa Samiranga” and “Saindhav,” have 47 thousand and 69 thousand interests, respectively.

This data indicates a strong audience preference for “Hanuman.” Considering this high enthusiasm, some may find it unfair that the movie is not allocated a more significant share of screens compared to “Guntur Karam” in Hyderabad on January 12.

However, HanuMan will have paid premieres on January 11th.
