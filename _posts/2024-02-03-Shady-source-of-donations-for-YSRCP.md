### By Suresh Reddy

It is not surprising that Janasena is funded by Pawan Kalyan garu. And, also, we see on the social network daily that his fans, supporters, political analysts donate money and they proudly post that they donated money to Janasena party. It is very heartening to see that. Also, it is common and legal that organizations donate money to political parties. But, when the source of that donation is shady or unknown then it should be questioned and exposed.

It is very well known that at least in 30+ cases Jagan is involved. It is also known that he is on bail. With out the permission of government, he cannot leave the country. He is Andhra Pradesh CM now. And, he heads the YSRCP party. And, that party needs donations and organizations donate money to that party too.
