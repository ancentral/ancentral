Elections are coming. Political equations are changing. From the down South of India, chief ministers and opposition party leaders have been shuttling between Delhi and their state capitals. 

Coming to Andhra Pradesh, these coming elections are very crucial for its development. Janasena and TDP are stronger than ever. Pawan Kalyan had put a mammoth of effort in bringing awareness about YSRCP government and their faulty practices. Thanks to Varahi Yaatras.

As and when Pawan Kalyan has been garnering so much of support from public, no wonder TDP and Janasena joined an alliance. As every Andhra person feels why Pawan Kalyan should be Chief Minister, it would be hard for TDP to bite it.

While the situations are developing, the party leaders keep meeting their alliances and partners. TDP chief Chandra Babu Naidu garu met Amit Shah. 

> It is heard that Amit Shah is very much inclined to see Pawan Kalyan as CM and sharing of power in terms of years. And, Amit Shah proposed this to Chandrababu Naidu garu.

We all want good days for Andhra Pradesh. Let us hope for the best.
