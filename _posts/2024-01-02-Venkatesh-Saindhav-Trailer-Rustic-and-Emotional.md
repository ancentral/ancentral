After a long gap, Victory Venkatesh is back to the action genre with Sailesh Kolanu’s directorial Saindhav. Today, the makers launched the theatrical trailer. It starts with exploring the bond between Venkatesh and Baby Sara. SaiKo, played by Venkatesh, is very fond of his daughter. While everything is going normally, SaiKo learns that his daughter is suffering from a medical problem called “Spinal Muscular Atrophy.”

The little girl needs to be given a vial, but it costs a whopping 17 crores. What did SaiKo do next? What challenges did he go through to obtain the vial? What is the reason for his enmity with Nawazuddin Siddique? Who actually is this Saindhav? The answers will be known on 13th January 2024.

Victory Venkatesh is one actor who can do justice to any role. The trailer presents Venky in an action avatar, and the senior actor has showcased complete conviction. The actor is terrific in the action sequences, and his looks are superb. The director assured a bloodbath with Saindhav along with beautiful emotions.

The production values are splendid, and the visuals look excellent. From the trailer, it appears that what Vikram is to Kamal Haasan, Saindhav will be for Venkatesh. Saindhav also stars Shraddha Srinath, Ruhani Sharma, Andrea Jeremiah, Arya, Mukesh Rishi, Jisshu Sengupta, and others in crucial roles. Venkat Boyanapalli, under Niharika Entertainment, produced this flick. Santosh Narayanan composed the tunes.
