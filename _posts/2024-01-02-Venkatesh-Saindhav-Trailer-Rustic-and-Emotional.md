Following the mammoth success of RRR, Tollywood star performer Jr NTR joined hands with the talented director Koratala Siva for the high-octane action drama Devara-Part 1. Bollywood beauty Janhvi Kapoor is cast to romance Jr NTR in this movie.

Amidst heightened anticipation, the team has released a glimpse of the movie online, and it’s outstanding. The 1-minute 20-second clip is brimming with intense bloodbath scenes, showcasing Taraka as Devara. A group of thugs trying to board a ship meets their demise by Devara’s hands, floating in The Red Sea. The glimpse is remarkable, accompanied by a powerful background score of Anirudh Ravichander and captivating visuals. Fans are thrilled by Jr NTR’s new appearance.

Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan is playing the baddie in this high-budget flick, produced under the banners of NTR Arts and Yuvasudha Arts. Prakash Raj, Shine Tom Chacko, Srikanth, and Murali Sharma are also a part of this movie, slated for a massive release on April 5, 2024, in multiple Indian languages.
