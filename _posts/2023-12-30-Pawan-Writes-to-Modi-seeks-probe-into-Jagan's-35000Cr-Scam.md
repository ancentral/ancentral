Jana Sena Party (JSP) chief Pawan Kalyan wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to initiate a probe by central agencies into an alleged scam in the distribution of house sites and construction of houses for the poor in Andhra Pradesh.

In his 5-page letter to PM Modi, he accused the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government of carrying out the multi-crore scam in the name of distribution of house sites and construction of houses for the poor.

The letter also laid stress on the misappropriation of thousands of crores of public funds by the YSRCP-led government. He emphasised how the state government has wasted thousands of crores of rupees of public money.

"A basic estimate, upon calculating the figures given by the state government itself, exposes a humongous financial misappropriation of Rs 35,141 crore only on purported 'acquisition' of land for the project," he said in his letter.

"The swindling in the name of land acquisition has been so high that a ruling party legislator himself sought an inquiry by the state Vigilance and Enforcement Department but the government turned a blind eye. Land prices were artificially increased many fold and only paltry amounts were paid to the land owners, while the ruling party leaders pocketed the 'extra' money..." he added in his letter to the Prime Minister.

In the concluding part of his letter to the Prime Minister, Kalyan sought action against the accused involved in the alleged scam and demanded that steps be taken for the recovery of the funds.

"I also request you to bring the guilty to book and initiate steps for recovery of the misappropriated public money," he said in his letter to the PM.

"We firmly believe that it's only under your leadership (that) justice can be ensured to lakhs of homeless families in the state," he added.
