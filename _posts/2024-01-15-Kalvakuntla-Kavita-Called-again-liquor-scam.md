Kalvakuntla Kavitha, daughter of K Chandrasekhara Rao, was once again called to appear by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday, January 15 as part of its ongoing investigation into the Delhi Liquor policy case.

On receiving the summons, Kavitha wrote to ED that she would not be appearing before the directorate as the matter is pending with the Supreme Court. Kavitha was previously Examined in connection with the probe in March 2023. In September, when she was initially summoned by the enforcement direct rate, she thought the relief from the Supreme Court, which granted her reprieve. 

The ED in its prosecution complaint, has stated that the tweaking of the excise policy was orchestrated to recover the alleged kickback of rupees 100 crore from the South Group.

The ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation suspect that a group unknown as the "South group" allegedly paid Rs. 100 crore to the AAP party government in Delhi to influence the now withdrawn Delhi liquor policy of 2021-22.

The agency has additionally accused Kavitha of destroying mobile phones to prevent digital evidence from being tracked back to her. Both Kavitha and the AAP vehemently deny these allegations.
