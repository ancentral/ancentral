This coming elections are going to be crucial for Andhra Pradesh and Telugu people. Besides, people say, "crucial for Jagan also to escape the jail term." 

No wonder the grapevine is that Jagan and YSRCP are spending more than 20 Crores just to influence people with social networking celebrities.

> The idea is to buy celebrities and make them tell good things about YSRCP

The Andhra Pradesh state lost everything that is prosperous about it. And, with Jagan's governance people say that it is at the bottom of rankings in any aspect. Also, YSRCP has been posting fake statistics in it's official Twitter account.

> With Siddham sabha, again YSRCP is making freebies and promises after wasting 4-and-half years of prime time of Andhra Pradesh. 

Who's gonna believe it Jagan?
