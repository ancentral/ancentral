## What this movie is about?

The film's story is set in 2008. Mallikarjun (Suhas) is a barber living in Ambajipeta village. Padmavathi (Saranya) is a government school teacher. They are twins hailing from lower social group (saamaajika vargam). The protoginost falls in love with higher "class" girl. And, how the situations takes turns is the story.


## Performances

Every actor did their part the very good. Goparaju Ramana garu is excellent as usual. For Suhas, it is a cake walk and it is not new for him to act in this kind of story. So, it is like appearing for the same exam again for him in which he excelled already.

## Technicalities

The direction is decent. Nothing new. You will find the narration is good. The cinematography and music is very good. They left their marks on the screen very well.

## Analysis

The problem with this movie is - we watched it already
1. In the trailer itself.
2. In other movies

Nothing new in this movie at all. 

This is a very sensitive topic - caste. But, the attrocities need to be addressed. So, everyone should allow others to speak about it. And, each and every Telugu audience had watched many such movies. They would expect a new story or a new narration. But, just for the viewership, you cannot keep on digging the same story. This movie was attempted not to make a good movie, but to cater to some audience to get something in return.

> If the director thought this movie is different in story, or screenplay or how he canned or grabbed the performance from actors, he would be wrong. Each and every aspect in this movie such as story, the conflict, the narration or whatever - you already watched it several times. 

This movie is just feels like part two of the Color Photo movie. In fact, the trailer itself gave away almost everything that we need to know about the movie. It is not wrong that two movies could have similar narration, similar story line or so many commonalities.


> A story needs conflict to make the protagonist a hero. The conflict in this movie is very artificially created just for the sake of walking the story further. And, the conflict is just the one that you watched 100 times in other movies. It is so artificial that audience would feel awkward about it and used to about it. And, the consequence of it is that the following story would not be giving strong base for the audience to “believe” the story.

The emotional scenes are just there awkwardly because we have templates for the movies. The scenes are not convincing. This movie is mixture of Rangasthalam, Uppena and Dasara.

## Thumbs Up
- Suhas performance
- Goparaju garu
