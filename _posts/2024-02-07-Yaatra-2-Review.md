## What this movie is about?

Well, this is a sequel of the Yaatra movie. It is supposed to be a biopic movie of YSR and Jagan.

## Performances

Performance wise, Jiiva and Mammootty are adequate. They did their part well. 

But the problem is lies with Mammootty and Jiiva trying to imitate the histrionics of YSR and Jagan, respectively, is not good. It would not appeal the audience at all. Jiiva trying to imitate Jagan irks many audience - coupling hands, head tilt, smiling and acting. It looks very odd on the screen. There is a big disconnect. 

> It is a tough job for Jiiva also as he has to appear like Jagan with that head tilting, that smile and at the same time, he needs to act. There is a big disconnect. 

Mammootty has no where near the histrionics of YSR. You would not see YSR in Mammootty at all.

## Technicalities

The direction is, well, nothing new. Not hard at all as the goal of the director is not to make a great movie but to peddle exaggerated agenda and lies to the targeted audience. You will find the narration is good. 

Music is very good at some scenes. The cinematography is just apt. The ambience of some scenes is good. It worked well from both the perspectives of Cinematography, direction and music.

## Analysis

The problem with this movie is - from the starting to the end, it is just exaggerated. The incidents that never happened were shown as if they happened. It feels like they are peddling so much of agenda and lies via this movie. The sentiment is disproportionately increased. And, it appears so odd on the screen. It would not even work on OTT.

> Especially the scene of the blind man is too odd. While, we know that on social media itself it is debunked that that scene was a lie.

At the same time, it is obvious that this movie is only for the YSRCP fans. This movie would not work with anybody else. In the first 10 minutes itslef they would feel to leave the theater. 

## Thumbs Up
- Cinematography
- Dialogues that come here and there that go well with any political party not just YSRCP

## Thumbs Down
- Production values are not good.
- Music did not serve well for this movie. Santosh Narayanan is highly-qualified for this movie. 
- Many of the scenes feel lagging due to the exaggerated sentiment that feel that they are telling to try lies.
- Elections agenda. Elections agenda. Elections agenda.

By the way, what are the ticket rates for this movie though?
