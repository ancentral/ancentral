It has been 33 years since RGV's Shiva released. RGV's fans still brags about it. And, they are right about it. After that movie there are only couple of movies that were upto good. Pundits wonder what kind of credibility he has. People say that last good movie of RGV was Sarkar. People are wondering who are still producing the films with him. Well, the answer is - politcal leaders, looks like!

He acts like the mouthpiece of YSRCP while claiming that he is not at all have knowledge in politics or have any interest to know about. But, he still keeps making agenda based movies to show TDP, it's leaders and Pawan Kalyan on bad light, as people wonder. Also, people strongly feel that he is portraying so much of lies through his films that getting produced having an agenda provided by some political leaders. And, he releases the movies during the elections times.

Besides making movies to shed bad light on TDP and Janasena, he uses Twitter extensively for the same. During the last elections, he made Lakshmi's NTR movie which stirred up a lot of interest due to it's controversial elements. So, he might have thought Vyooham also might work the same way. But, exactly opposite is happening. People stopped watching his interviews a longtime back. And, who will watches his movies, people feel. One of the consequence of his tweets or such movies is to irk and agetate Janasena and TDP supporters. Now, even they are not even giving an ounce of interest.

> One of the consequence of his tweets or his movies is to irk and agetate Janasena, TDP supporters and Pawan Kalyan fans. Now, even they are not giving an ounce of interest towards his tweets or movies. So, the leaders who are funding his movies are losing all the money that they are funding.

People are strongly believing, " Vyooham and Sapatham movies would not even get released. Even if they released, it will turn out bad for YSRCP" as people have been understanding the things lately.

The question is, "Is RGV really that great of a director?"
