Pawan-Trivikram-Atlee coming together. Powerstar Pawan Kalyan is set to join forces with the blockbuster director Atlee and the maestro of storytelling, Trivikram, for an upcoming film that is already creating waves in the gossip circles. According to the grapevine, this high-profile project will showcase Pawan Kalyan in the lead role, with Atlee at the helm of direction and Trivikram taking on the role of producer.

> Currently immersed in his political commitments, Pawan Kalyan has a slew of film projects in the pipeline, including "OG," "Ustaad Bhagat Singh," and "Hari Hara Veera Mallu." The actor-turned-politician is slated to commence shooting for "OG" post the Andhra Pradesh General Elections, followed by subsequent commitments.

If the rumors hold true, Pawan Kalyan is anticipated to collaborate with Atlee upon completing his existing commitments. Interestingly, there is also speculation about Atlee teaming up with Allu Arjun. Known for his directorial prowess, Atlee's last film, "Jawan," achieved the remarkable feat of being the top Indian grosser in 2023.

Having presented Shah Rukh Khan in an unprecedented avatar, Atlee has garnered immense interest from A-list actors, intensifying the anticipation surrounding his next directorial venture. The potential collaboration between Powerstar Pawan Kalyan, Atlee, and Trivikram has undoubtedly become a topic of great excitement and curiosity within the entertainment industry.
