Well, elections are coming in Andhra Pradesh. The equations are changing never like before. Everyone has their strategy to keep their vote bank up and active via various acitivities. One such activity is engaging them with movies. Yaatra 2 is such movie.

Since the beginning of the teaser, peddling agenda starts. People on Social Networks are unanimously telling particularly about the blind man's scene in which he alone waits for Jagan's coming for the betterment of Andhra Pradesh. Don't lauch. Through out the teaser, there are such scenes with exaggerated emotional music, emotional scenes and histrionics of the actors. 

> You immediately feel this movie is just an agenda based where the makers tried to portray all accusations on Jagan are just conspiracies. No way, people would believe that.

No wonder this movie had to shows YSR who died in helicopter crash to stir up the emotions of the watchers a.k.a YSRCP's vote bank. The teaser, hence the movie, wants to portray that Jagan is not a criminal and the "jail" episode is just political vandetta. Come on!

> No wonder this movie had to shows YSR who died in helicopter crash to stir up the emotions of the watchers a.k.a YSRCP's vote bank.

But, one thing is for sure that people felt so much cringe while watching the exaggerated emotional scenes trying very hard to portray Jagan as a person who was played but mere a saint and works harder for the betterment of Andhra Pradesh. Hey, come on!
