By Sunita Sri Chaganti

Hindus around India and the world are looking forward for the date, January 22, 2024, on the occasion of the Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi temple inauguration. The auspicious mood has been triggering so much of national integrity around the Hindu families, streets, villages, towns and through out India. Every Hindu is feeling blessed and spreading the one-family sentiment among themselves.

So many integrity scenes could be witnessed even at the level of villages. People are celebrating with 11-day Ram Sita bhajans. People are distributing Jai Sree Ram stickers. People in the families are making saffron flags and donating it for free. Every temple became the place of festive celebrations.

Hindu people are distributing Akshatas as a blessing, by going house to house, and asking people to light 5 diyas, chant "Sree Rama Jaya Rama Jaya Jaya Rama" for 108 times during the inauguration and read Rama Raksha Stotram. 

> Families are so happy that their kids are embracing this festive season and learning about the Ram Janmabhoomi and how it was demolished by Muslim kings. And, they are so happily telling that their kids are decorating their homes for the January 22, 2024 celebrations. 

People are feeling that we need to learn more about RSS and VHP and how they were intentionally blacklisted by Congress and alliance governments.

> Finally, Atal Bihari Vajapayee, Lal Krishna Advani and Modi's efforts are fruitful. 

Jai Sri Ram!
