Y S Sharmiila, daughter of Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, wife of Reverend Anil, sister of Y S Jagan. Sharmila's image is in doldrums for the kind of approach she took in shaping up her political career. People have strong sentiments over the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and Congress party. More over people are strongly feeling that how could Sharmila have an alliance with Congress party who biasedly bifurcated Andhra Pradesh.

It seems to be that Andhra Pradesh people lost all the respect for Congress party for drawing the entire state to such economical state. People strongly feel that Y S Jagan made it so much worse. And, now, hearing the name of Sharmila is not going very tasty with the minds of Andhra people. 

While Pawan Kalyan has been highly active in politics by pointing out the affairs of our Andhra Pradesh, and wind is so positive for him, this news of Sharmila is adding more favors to Pawan. More over TDP is walking so close with Janasena. 

> Peole are strongly feeling that the Jagan's vote bank would split towards Sharmila and it will make more worse for Jagan.

By seeing all these factors, the people of Andhra are strongly feeling that Jagan and Sharmila will so many speed-bumps ahead in their careers. After all, Andhra people are looking forward to see brighter days for Andhra Pradesh while listening to Pawan Kalyan's speeches. We will have to wait and see what is ahead for Andhra Pradesh.
