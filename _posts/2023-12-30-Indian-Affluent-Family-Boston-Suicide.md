An Indian-origin couple, along with their teenage daughter, were found dead at their Massachusetts mansion, in what media reports suggest was a case of domestic violence. The bodies of Rakesh Kamal, 57, his wife, Teena, 54, and their 18-year-old daughter Ariana, were found Thursday in their Dover mansion at about 7:30 pm, according to Norfolk District Attorney (DA) Michael Morrissey.

Teena and her husband Rakesh Kamal, who also went by the nickname Rick, owned an education systems company called EduNova, which was dissolved in December 2021. The company was launched in 2016 as per state records, with Teena Kamal being listed as the chief operating officer on the company’s website.

As per the website, Teena was an alum of Harvard University in the United States as well as Delhi University, with an experience spanning three decades in the education and technology industries. She was also listed as one of the board of directors for the American Red Cross of Massachusetts.

According to his biography on the EduNova website, Teena’s husband Rakesh was an alumnus of Boston University, MIT Sloan School of Management, as well as Stanford University. It also stated that he has “held many executive positions in the education-consulting field” before working at EduNova.

Meanwhile, the couple’s daughter Ariana, according to her LinkedIn profile, was studying neuroscience at Middlebury College. The institution is a USD 64,800-a-year private liberal arts school in Vermont.

The Kamals had purchased the Massachusetts mansion, a 19,000-square-foot estate which boasts 11 bedrooms, for USD 4 million in 2019. The area, one of the richest in the state, was “a nice neighbourhood and a safe community”, the DA said.

However, the couple appeared to have faced financial problems in recent years, online records show. Teena had filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2022 – listing between USD 1 million and USD 10 million in liabilities in the filings. But the case was dismissed two months later due to insufficient documentation.

In addition to this, the mansion previously occupied by the family — estimated to be worth USD 5.45 million — went into foreclosure a year ago. It was finally sold to the Massachusetts-based Wilsondale Associates LLC for USD 3 million, according to The Post.
