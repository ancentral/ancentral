TDP and Jana Sena are working on a joint electoral plan as they are preparing for a hugely challenging next two months with the elections to be held in April. The respective chiefs of these two parties Chandra Babu Naidu and Pawan Kalyan sat down for a meeting at Babu’s house in Undavalli today.

Reportedly, several important topics came to discussion at the meeting and it was a largely productive one in the context of the joint campaign of TDP and JSP for the fast-approaching elections.

Chandrababu and Pawan Kalyan came to a primary understanding on the seat sharing and a decision is taken on the number of seats that will be allocated for either of the parties. The number hasn’t been furnished to the media but the parties are in principle understanding of it.

The mutual decision is that no matter the seat allocation and the numbers game, the most important aim is to work on the strengths to make sure the alliance ultimately wins.

Whatever seats are given to JSP, if there are fundamentally strong TDP candidates and leaders here, Naidu will assume the responsibility of carefully explaining the equations and pacifying them. Pawan Kalyan is also ready to explain the equations of the alliance and instruct his party workers that getting more seats is not as important as the overall good of the alliance.

The decision on the first list of candidates has been taken and it will be announced soon. The announcement of the joint manifesto and candidates is on the horizon, say reports.
