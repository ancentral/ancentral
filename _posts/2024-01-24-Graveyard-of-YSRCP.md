- By Suresh Reddy

People's voice is...

> YSRCP is no less of a party that looted resources and wasted potential and time of Andhra Pradesh. For five years, under the rule of Jagan Mohan Reddy, there is nothing to see in Andhra Pradesh. More over, we lost a lot.

People are joining Janasena party. People are moving away from YSRCP. They are slowly realizing that free schemes would hinder the state at many levels - roads, electricity, water and other bills. The youngsters in the families are educating the family members to not to fall for such cheap money-looting schemes and they are explaining how it would harden the future times.

Janasena chief Pawan Kalyan's popularity is growing day by day. His Vaaraahi yaatras were highly successful. He educated about the consequences of Jagan's policies continuously. When YSRCP used their people to mock Pawan Kalyan and his comments, he still continued standing firm on his views and continued educated people and youth.

> People in Andhra are hoping to see a change in government. They are realizing what has been lost. They are hopeful and looking forward to elect their first ever new people's leader.
