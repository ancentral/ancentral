Already there is a strong opinions in public about biased family laws in India. Organizations like [Voice for Men, India](https://voiceformenindia.com) has been highly vocal about such laws. Since more than a decade, the divorce rates have been highter than ever. "Voice for Men, India" organization has been bringing awareness about false 498A and Domestic Violence cases a lot. They are very vocal with the hashtag of #CrimeHasNoGender (Crime has no gender). This hash tag is to remove the general belief of people that women do not commit crime. Well, a shocking incident happened in Goa.

A 39-year-old Bengaluru start-up founder, Suchana Seth, allegedly murdered her four-year-old son in Goa and travelled to Karnataka with his body before she was caught. She is the CEO of artificial intelligence start-up Mindful AI Lab. She was arrested in Karnataka's Chitradurga on Monday with her son's body in a bag.

> The motive for the shocking crime is not known yet but police suspect the CEO's estranged relationship with her husband as a possible reason behind the killing. It has been mentioned in many times on Twitter that, she is not happy with the court verdict about her husband's kid visitation rights. 

During inquiry Suchana Seth who murdered her 4 year old son told police that she had a troubled relationship with her husband and their divorce is nearly finalized. I have hunch that she might have filed fake cases against her husband. Her posts and writings pretty much indicates that she is a radical feminist.  She was unhappy that court order allowed her estranged husband Venkat Raman to meet their son every sunday. Consequently she allegedly planned to kill her minor son just a day before the scheduled meeting. 

People are shocked to learn about this and they are vocal on Social media about this. They are expressing their opinions to bring unbiased family laws.
