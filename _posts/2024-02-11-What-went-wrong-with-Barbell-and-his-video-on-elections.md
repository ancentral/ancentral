#### Article by Narasimha Reddy

I thank AndhraCentral for letting me write this article for them.

Since a day, there has been a topic about a Telugu person who posts movie reviews. The account name is Barbell Biryani. I am intentionally not posting his real name. As far as I know, I will mention what I understood. This might not be the total truth or the series of events. But, we need to understand several things here. I will try to explain.

### Who is Barbell Biryani?

Barbell Biryani is a Telugu person who went to USA to purise MS in Data Science. As people mentioned on Twitter, now he is working in USA on H1 work permit. As a hobby, and another source of income as himself claimed (see the references at the end of the article), he keeps posting videos by reviewing some movies mostly Indian movies. Also, he posts Pitch Meetings [which mimic this guy's videos](https://www.youtube.com/@PitchMeetings).

### YSRCP and recent acts of Social Media Influencers

It is up to you to decide if it is right or wrong when a political party uses/buys/gives-money to Social Media Influencers to make them tell some good things about that party. The odd thing is that, out of the blue, all of these influencers suddenly posting videos about YSRCP Party. The more weirder thing is that this is not even their genre of videos. For example, how it would sound if a person who always posts cooking videos posts about YSRCP party?

Have this on mind and read on.

### Barbell Biryani's recent video

This Barbell Biryani videos usally have exaggerated histrionics, jokes or diggings at a person/direction/music-composer/writer etc. He recently, again out of the blue, went out of his genre and posted a video about Andhra Pradesh Elections with title - `"Barbell Data Analysis | 2024 Andhra elections, predictions and discussion"`. 

I don't want to make this observation but I will do anyway because it is mentioned on Twitter many times. This Barbell Biryani guy is a Reddy person. Now, why does that matter?

Well, it is an unfortunate thing that caste still plays a role in Andhra Pradesh elections. YSRCP Party's cabinet is 70% Reddy people. And, people are wondering if he is also approached by YSRCP or not, or he is a supporter of YSRCP? IF he is a supporter of YSRCP, why suddenly posting this video about elections on a channel that does movies reviews?

At the same time, the way he spoke about Pawan Kalyan is not very good behavior at all as considered by thousands of people on Social Media. 

### H1 and YouTube income

When a person is on H1 working in USA, it is not allowed to have multiple incomes. It is not sure that if Barbell Biryani reports his income to Government of USA while declaring taxes. 

People on Twitter who are very much disturbed because of his video complained to USCIS, the organization that oversees lawful immigration to USA. 

We have to wait and see what will happen after all these incidents.

### Conclusion

People mention Freedom of Speech, Rights, rigth of expression etc. But, how far can it go? And while YSRCP or people associated with it are known to buy social media incfluencers, and they posting out-of-their-genre videos all of a sudden is fishy. 

What do we really conclude here? It is up to individual to look at these incidents and conclude.
