If someone has to give a report card for Jagan's governance, the report would not be good in any parameter. Andhra Pradesh's development had stalled since 5 years, literally. There is no stature of it's now under Jagan's governance. This is what people of Andhra are feeling.

During the election times of 2019, Jagan promised a lot of things. They are just unattainable. Yet, with the slogan of, "One chance", and money distribution for votes (as people say), he became Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Not a single day he worked for the development of Andhra Pradesh. 

### Here are the 9 promises he miserably failed in delivering

    1. Dropping CPS - Contributory Pension Scheme
    2. Special status for Andhra
    3. Liquor ban
    4. Building 30 Lakhs of homes
    5. Pension at the age of 45 years
    6. 3000/- Pension
    7. Job Calendar
    8. Rice scheme
    9. 200 units of free electricity

Who's money is he offering in the name of schemes? Instead of creating jobs or prospects or inviting industries to Andhra Pradesh, Jagan diverted all money to what? 

The coming elections are going to be tough for Jagan, people feel, while Pawan Kalyan has been touring like whirlwind pointing out each and every activity of Jagan's governance. Let us wait and see what is in stock for Andhra Pradesh.
